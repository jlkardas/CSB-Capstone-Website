                <p>The Computer Science and Business Program (CSB) at Lehigh University is a joint initiative between the College of Business and Economics and the Computer Science and Engineering department in the P.C. Rossin College of Engineering and Applied Science. Students who complete this demanding program are awarded a unique joint degree that comes from both colleges.  Graduates are equipped with the high-tech and business skills that are crucial at this time where the boundaries between the two fields are becoming increasingly blurred. </p>
                <p>The CSB Capstone Program is the culmination of the students' coursework at Lehigh, where they apply their skills working on high-impact projects for corporate sponsors. </p>
                <p>Sponsors have the opportunity to work with some of the best and brightest students Lehigh has to offer, while simultaneously contributing to their educations. </p>
